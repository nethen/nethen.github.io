# D is for Data &mdash; A Series of Visualizations
A collection of sketches made by Vancouver-based design engineer, Nathan Lew. Built as part of the Fall 2024 session of IAT355: Introduction to Visual Analytics at Simon Fraser University.

> [D is for Data](https://nethen.github.io) was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React.js](https://react.dev), [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion), [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) and [Lenis Scroll](https://darkroom.engineering/lenis). Deployment actions to Github Pages were borrowed from developer, [Greg Rickaby](https://github.com/gregrickaby/nextjs-github-pages).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). All setup instructions below were automatically generated by Next.js:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
